This repository demonstrates a common issue in Perl's foreach loop when combined with the 'last' statement. The provided code snippet shows a loop that iterates through an array of numbers.  The 'last' statement is used to prematurely exit the loop when a specific condition is met (in this case, when the number is equal to 5). However, this can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered, particularly when dealing with complex logic within the loop.
